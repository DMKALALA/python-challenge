### Python Challenge: PyBank and PyPoll Project

As part of my journey to enhance my programming and problem-solving skills, I completed a self-driven Python project tackling two real-world challenges: **PyBank** and  **PyPoll** . This project allowed me to dive deep into data analysis, automation, and effective script design.

#### **Project Overview**

1. **PyBank** : Financial Data Analysis
   I developed a Python script to analyze company financial data from `budget_data.csv`, containing "Date" and "Profit/Losses" columns. The script performed the following tasks:

* Calculated total months in the dataset.
* Summed total profit/loss values.
* Computed average changes in profit/loss over time.
* Identified the greatest increase and decrease in profits, including corresponding months.

    **Output Example** :


```
Financial Analysis
----------------------------
Total Months: 86
Total: $22,564,198
Average Change: $-8311.11
Greatest Increase: Aug-16 ($1,862,002)
Greatest Decrease: Feb-14 ($-1,825,558)
```


2. **PyPoll** : Election Data Automation
   I built a Python script to automate vote tallying from `election_data.csv`, which included "Voter ID," "County," and "Candidate" columns. The script accomplished the following:

* Counted total votes.
* Generated a breakdown of votes and percentages for each candidate.
* Determined the winner based on the popular vote.

    **Output Example** :


```
Election Results
-------------------------
Total Votes: 369,711
Charles Casper Stockham: 23.05% (85,213)
Diana DeGette: 73.81% (272,892)
Raymon Anthony Doane: 3.14% (11,606)
-------------------------
Winner: Diana DeGette
```

#### **Key Takeaways**

* **Data Analysis** : I strengthened my ability to parse and manipulate datasets programmatically.
* **Automation** : The scripts automated manual, repetitive tasks, saving time and reducing errors.
* **Efficiency** : Leveraged Python's libraries for cleaner and more efficient code, ensuring scalability for larger datasets.
* **Version Control** : All progress was tracked using Git, demonstrating my commitment to clean and organized workflows.

This project exemplifies my capability to tackle real-world problems with Python, providing both actionable insights and streamlined automation.
